# Description

# **Caesar Cipher and Vigenère Cipher - A Fun Cryptography Project**

## **Description**

This project explores two classical encryption techniques: **Caesar Cipher** and **Vigenère Cipher**. I built this using **Python and Flask**, deepening my understanding of Flask applications while experimenting with fundamental cryptographic principles.

## **Fundamentals of Cryptography**

While working on this project, I explored two classical encryption techniques:

### **Caesar Cipher**

I learned that the **Caesar Cipher** is a simple shift cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of places. For example, with a shift of 3:

- **A → D**, **B → E**, **C → F**, etc.

Though basic, it introduced me to the concept of substitution ciphers, a fundamental building block of cryptography.

### **Vigenère Cipher**

The **Vigenère Cipher** took things further by using a keyword to shift letters in a repeating pattern. Unlike the fixed shift in the Caesar Cipher, this method applies different shifts based on the keyword, making it much harder to crack. This helped me understand the importance of key-based encryption in securing messages.

## **Features**

✔ Encrypt text using **Caesar Cipher** or **Vigenère Cipher**  
✔ Decrypt encrypted messages  
✔ **Download** encrypted text as a file  
✔ Flask-powered web interface for ease of use

## **Building with Python and Flask**

I developed this project using **Flask**, a lightweight web framework in Python. Flask allowed me to create a simple **web-based encryption and decryption tool**, where users can input text and apply either cipher for encoding and decoding messages. This hands-on experience improved my understanding of:

✅ Flask routing and templates  
✅ Handling user input with Flask forms  
✅ Implementing encryption logic in Python  
✅ Basic web development and UI integration

This project was a great way to blend cryptography with web development, making it both fun and educational.
