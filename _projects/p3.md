# Description

The study on "Low Cost Housing with Traditional Features" explores innovative methods to create affordable, durable housing. It focuses on reducing construction costs in the initial stage and identifying ways to minimize long-term maintenance expenses, using materials such as bamboo, MS tubular, concrete, wood, and interlocking bricks. The research examines the growing housing demands driven by migration from rural to urban areas, particularly in urban centers and Thromdes (Thimphu, Phuentsholing, Gelephu, and Samdrup Jongkhar). By evaluating conventional construction techniques and proposing more cost-effective alternatives, the study aims to provide practical solutions for improving housing affordability and sustainability in both urban and rural areas.

# Parameters for the choice of materials

The materials considered for the low-cost housing project were carefully selected based on several key parameters to ensure their suitability for affordable and durable construction. These parameters include:

1. Local Availability: The materials must be easily accessible within the region to reduce transportation costs and promote local sourcing.
2. Low Cost: The materials must be affordable, making the construction process cost-effective.
3. Durability: The materials must be strong and long-lasting to ensure the longevity of the structure.
4. Characteristics: The physical properties of the materials, such as strength, flexibility, and insulation, must meet the requirements for effective construction.
5. Ease of Handling: The materials should be easy to handle, transport, and work with, reducing labor and time costs.

# Result

The analysis of the cost estimations for conventional and low-cost housing reveals significant savings in the construction of low-cost houses. Two types of housing, **1BHK** and **Duplex**, were compared to highlight the differences in cost between the conventional and low-cost approaches.

1. **1BHK House**: The cost estimation for a conventional 1BHK house is **₹757,353.14**, while the low-cost house is priced at **₹417,701.53**. This results in a total cost difference of **₹339,651.61**, representing a **44.84%** reduction in cost. The substantial savings suggest that the low-cost construction methods are highly effective in reducing the overall financial burden for building affordable housing.

2. **Duplex House**: For the duplex model, the conventional house costs **₹1,733,646**, compared to the low-cost duplex at **₹1,231,350**. The difference in cost amounts to **₹522,295**, resulting in a **28.95%** reduction. This further reinforces the potential of low-cost housing methods in offering affordable alternatives without compromising structural integrity.

In conclusion, the low-cost housing approach provides a viable solution to reducing construction expenses, particularly for individuals and communities seeking affordable housing options. The cost reductions of **44.84%** for the 1BHK house and **28.95%** for the duplex model indicate that adopting these materials and techniques could significantly address housing affordability challenges. The findings highlight the practicality of integrating low-cost housing methods in urban and rural development projects, especially in areas with a high demand for affordable housing.
